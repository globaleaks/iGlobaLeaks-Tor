# iGlobaLeaks

iGlobaLeaks is the iOS client part of a larger Whistleblowing project called [GlobaLeaks](https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks/wiki/)

The code is still under development as it is part of my final disseration project due the 30th August 2013. By that date there will be a totally working alpha version.
